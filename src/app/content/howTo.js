`###### A word of introduction

Pro-con lists are one of the best known decision making tools. But while they look basic, it's easy to use them in the wrong way.

To help you out, here are few guidelines that should make using them easy and satisfying.

###### Guidelines

**Use them for the right decisions**

Use pros and cons only for 0/1 decisions, yes/no, go/no-go.

**Ask the right questions**

Questions should be simple and straightforward, with only two options as an answer.
Like: "Should I do that or not?", "Should I buy a new car or stay with the old one?".

If your default question has more than one answer, break it into fewer and simpler questions.
